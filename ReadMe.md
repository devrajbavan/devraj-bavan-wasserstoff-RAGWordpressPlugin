# RAG-Based Query Suggestion Chatbot with Chain of Thought for WordPress Sites

## Overview

This project involves the development of a versatile, intelligent chatbot that utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system enhanced with a Chain of Thought (CoT) strategy. The chatbot is integrated into various WordPress blogs and sites, designed to handle and adapt to a wide range of topics, maintaining logical and contextually relevant interactions.

## System Design

### Requirement Analysis

- **Objective**: Create a chatbot that can adapt its interaction style and content based on the specific WordPress site it is deployed on.
- **Actions**:
  - Perform an analysis of typical user queries and interactions across a range of blogs to gather diverse requirements.
  - Design user interaction flows that guide users through their queries using a series of contextually relevant questions, enhanced by a logical chain of thought.

### Architecture Design

- **Objective**: Build a scalable and efficient system capable of real-time data retrieval, processing, and dynamic response generation.
- **Components**:
  - **Data Retrieval**: Utilize WordPress APIs to fetch real-time content updates.
  - **Embedding Generator**: Convert textual content into vector embeddings using models like Sentence-BERT.
  - **Vector Database**: Employ a system like Faiss to store and retrieve embeddings efficiently.
  - **RAG Processor**: Integrate RAG to generate responses based on retrieved information.
  - **Chain of Thought Module**: Develop this module to enhance the RAG outputs with logical progression and context continuity.
  - **User Interface**: Design an interactive chat interface that can dynamically display the chatbot’s thought process.

## Implementation

### WordPress Data Retrieval and Embedding Generation

- **Real-Time Data Fetching**: Implement hooks and REST API calls within WordPress to fetch new and updated content.
- **Pseudocode for Embedding Update**:
  ```python
  function update_embeddings_on_new_post(post):
      text = extract_text(post)
      embeddings = generate_embeddings(text)
      update_vector_database(post.id, embeddings)

## RAG Setup and Chain of Thought Integration
- **RAG Configuration** : Utilize Hugging Face’s Transformers to configure the RAG system.
- **Chain of Thought Implementation**: Integrate a CoT strategy to process queries in a stepwise manner, improving the logical flow and relevance of responses.
- **Pseudocode for Chain of Thought Processing**:

  ```python
  function process_query_with_chain_of_thought(user_query, previous_context):
    initial_response = rag_generate_response(user_query)
    thought_steps = develop_reasoning_steps(initial_response, previous_context)
    final_response = refine_response_based_on_thought_steps(thought_steps)
    return final_response


## Integration with WordPress
- **Plugin Development**: Create a WordPress plugin that allows easy integration and configuration of the chatbot across sites.
- **API Implementation**: Develop secure REST APIs using Flask or FastAPI for backend communication between the WordPress plugin and the AI system.
## Testing and Evaluation
- **Functional Testing**: Test the complete system functionality including data fetching, response generation, and UI interaction.
- **Performance Testing**: Measure response times, accuracy, and scalability.
- **Chain of Thought Testing**: Specifically evaluate the logic and coherence of the responses generated by the CoT strategy.
## Documentation and Reporting
- **System Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation covering system architecture, codebases, integration methods, and usage instructions.
- **Operational Manual**: Include setup guides, configuration details, and troubleshooting instructions for end-users and system administrators.
- **Project Report**: Outline challenges encountered, solutions implemented, and performance metrics, along with future improvement recommendations.

## Running the Application
- **Clone the Repository**:
  ``` sh
  git clone https://github.com/devrajbavan/devraj-bavan-wasserstoff-RAGWordpressPlugin.git
  cd devraj-bavan-wasserstoff-RAGWordpressPlugin

- **Install Dependencies**:
  ``` sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt

- **Run the Flask Application**:
    ```sh
    python app.py

- **Configure the WordPress Plugin**:
  - Upload the plugin to your WordPress site.
  - Activate the plugin from the WordPress admin panel.
  - Configure the plugin settings to connect with your Flask backend.
# Algorithm Explanation
## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
### RAG combines information retrieval and generation to answer questions:

- **Retrieval**: Uses a retriever model to find relevant documents from a corpus.
- **Generation**: Uses a generator model to produce an answer based on the retrieved documents.
## Chain of Thought (CoT)
### CoT enhances the reasoning ability of the RAG model:

- **Stepwise Reasoning**: Breaks down the query into smaller reasoning steps.
- **Contextual Continuity**: Ensures logical progression and maintains context through the conversation.
## System Flow
- **User Query**: The user inputs a query.
- **Data Retrieval**: The system retrieves relevant documents from the WordPress site using embeddings and vector search.
- **Initial Response Generation**: The RAG model generates an initial response.
- **Chain of Thought Processing**: The CoT module refines the response through logical steps.
- **Final Response**: The system delivers a contextually relevant and logically coherent answer to the user.
